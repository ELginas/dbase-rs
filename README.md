# dbase-rs

Rust library to read (and write) .dbf (dBase / FoxPro) files.

Reading File works well for most files
(if you have a problem reading one, don't hesitate to file an issue)

Writing produces files that most dbf reader should be able to read,
but the implementation of it is still a work in progress
